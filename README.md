# Quadriga-Whatsapp_Chat_Viewer
&emsp;&emsp;This project provides an efficient way to export chats from WhatsApp in a convenient and readable form. This makes it easier to check out your chat history.  
## Other functionalities
1. A range for the number of messages can be set in order to obtain only the required messages.
2. In case of group chats, the messages can be viewed in any of the members point of view.  
## How it works?
&emsp;&emsp;The required chat need to be exported from WhatsApp. The exported chat which would be in a text file format must be converted to a zip file. This zip file can then be placed at the dropzone of the site which would give the readable form of the exported chat. The range of the messages can be adjusted in the side panel. It also provides an option to choose the user whose point of view the chat is in.
